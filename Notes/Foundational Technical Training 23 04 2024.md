## How to Make Headings
We can make headings with the help of '#'. Keep in mind, the '#' count defines the importance of the heading

## For making Lists
To write lists, just use '-' symbol before the list items for bulleted lists. 
### Example
- item 1
- item 2

For number indexed lists use numbers instead of '-'.
### Example
1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3

# Agile
Agile is a project management approach that divides the project into several smaller phases or modules and allows developers to work on cycles of planning, development and evaluation

## Agile vs Waterfall Model
![Agile vs waterfall](Foundational%20Technical%20Training%2023%2004%202024\image.png)

The waterfall model is more rigid. Meaning, it is not flexible to adapt on-the go changes. From the requirement gathering phase everything happens in a preplanned manner without a single change. This makes it difficult to follow for a software project as softwares are not some civil project where any changes after concrete reinforcement is impossible.

For that reason the developers came up with a solution of **Agile Methodology**. Agile works by dividing the software project into several phases where the changes can adapted easily on the go. It prioritised customer and developer opinions over pen & paper.
