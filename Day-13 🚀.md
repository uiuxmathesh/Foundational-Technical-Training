## Git Commits

```

Once it is typed the output will show the changes matching the pick-axe syntax. You can highlight them using `/`  

## Undoing commit

    ```powershell
    git revert <commit_id>
    ```
    
    Undoing commits using `reset` (SOFT reset: For editing the commit and commiting again)
    
    ```powershell
    git reset --SOFT HEAD~1
    ```
    
    Undoing commits using `reset` (HARD reset: For deleting the commit and commiting again)
    
    ```powershell
    git reset --HARD HEAD~1
    ```
